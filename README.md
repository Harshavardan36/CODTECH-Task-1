Key Features :
      User Input: Users can select an operation and input two numbers.
      Arithmetic Operations: The program performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on input given  by the user.
      Error Handling: The program handles division by zero errors and invalid user input.
      Simple Menu: A text-based menu allows users to select an operation.
	  
Technical Details:
     Programming Language: Python
     Functions: Four functions are defined for each arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
     Input/Output: User input is taken using the input() function and output is displayed using print() statements.

Finally we comes to know that to
  1.Create a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations.
  2.Handle user input and errors in a user-friendly manner.
  3.Demonstrate basic programming concepts such as functions, conditional statements, and loops.
